Welcome to lilDocs! A full-stack, single-page GoogleDocs clone where users can create rich-text documents and share documents with other users. It was designed using Ruby on Rails in the backend and React/Redux in the front end. The React-Quill library was implemented for rich-text editing (including document templates), and a debounce method was implemented for seamless autosaving.
